## 📌 TL;DR
This repo shows how to let the **data shape itself into the stories investors already use, turning metric overload into actionable stock lists** (“Undervalued”, “High
Growth”, “Prime Quality”).  
A lightweight, sector-neutral K-Means pipeline turns 21 fundamentals for every
S&P 500 stock into five factor buckets and a handful of intuitive style tiers,
followed by a 7-week forward sanity test.

**Tier names used in each bucket**

| Bucket                    | What it measures                                                              | How to read the tiers                                                                                                                                                                         |
| ------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Value**                 | Sector-neutral P / E and P / S ratios (cheap vs expensive relative to peers). | **Undervalued** → trading at the lowest valuation multiples in its sector. <br> **Fair Value** → near the sector median. <br> **Over-valued** → richest multiples, priced for perfection.     |
| **Growth**                | Revenue-growth rate and Return-on-Assets (ROA).                               | **High Growth** → top-half of the sector on both growth and efficiency. <br> **Low Growth** → bottom-half (mature or stagnating businesses).                                                  |
| **Quality**               | Profit margin and ROA, sector-normalised.                                     | **High Quality** → fat margins and strong asset returns. <br> **Average Quality** → middle band. <br> **Low Quality** → thin margins and weak ROA.                                            |
| **Balance-Sheet Defence** | Current ratio and Debt-to-Equity (liquidity plus leverage).                   | **High Defence** → high liquidity, low leverage—built for downturns. <br> **Average Defence** → sector middle ground. <br> **Low Defence** → stretched balance-sheet, less cushion.           |
| **Momentum / Risk**       | 3-year Sharpe ratio and maximum draw-down.                                    | **High Momentum** → strong risk-adjusted up-trend, shallow pull-backs. <br> **Average Momentum** → middling trend. <br> **Low Momentum** → weak or choppy price action, deep past draw-downs. |


## 🚧 Work in progress

* **Streamlit deployment** – interactive screener (“Show me cheap stocks with steady margins”) - linking code so they all wrok together
* * **LLM query layer** – translate plain English prompts into saved filters.  
* **Robust data sources** – investigating *Financial Modeling Prep*, *SecAPI*, and point-in-time fundamentals to reduce survivorship bias.  
* **Multi-year back-test** – rolling Window + sector-neutral returns, transaction-cost model.   
* **Ranking engine** – within-bucket scoring by z-score distance to centroid.
